* What does it do?
 It simply takes a link like:
 https://github.com/magit/forge/blob/master/lisp/forge-core.el#L23

 or:

 https://github.com/magit/forge/blob/15d006d1aa7df254d8cd4521aaf209ec56de8465/lisp/forge-commands.el#L14

 And attempts to open the file locally in Magit, assuming you have already cloned the repository.
* FAQ
- How do I use it?
  + Copy a GitHub link and call the function.

- Why a separate package if it only has one function?
  + Because I'd like to test it out first, before proposing this to be part of magit or magit-forge.

- Does it only work with GitHub links?
  + In theory it should also work with GitLab, but I have never tested

- Are you going to publish it on MELPA?
  + I will. I just need to make sure this thing works first. It is at the very experimental stage.
